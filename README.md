# check-codeowners-dead-paths
Small python script that checks whether a path in CODEOWNERS points to a file that no longer exists. Currently does not check whether it has been moved or anything and is therefore very dumb, but I may add this in the future. 

To use, clone repo and run as 
`python main.py`
